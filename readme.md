## 📖 Overview

🚀🪐 This project is the solution of the problem statement provided by KJ Somaiya College of Engineering's hackathon, Hackstellar 2023!

The problem statement is about the need for sustainable investments to support the development of a Martian colony. 👨‍🚀🌱

John, a Martian colonist, wanted to invest in companies that shared his values of sustainability and responsible resource management, but found it difficult to identify trustworthy opportunities that aligned with his beliefs. 💰🌿

To address this issue, a sustainable finance organization commissioned a team to develop a user-friendly web 🌐 or mobile 📱 application that would provide a searchable 🔍 and filterable list of sustainable investment options, display relevant information 📊 about each company, and allow users to create a custom portfolio 📈 of sustainable investments and track their performance over time. The application would also provide educational resources 📚 on sustainable investing and may give recommendations for users based on their financial goals, risk tolerance, and values. 💻📈📚

Our team built a website 🌐, app 📱, and WhatsApp 📲 bot to address this problem and empower individual investors like John to make informed investment decisions that align with their values and promote sustainability for future generations, both on Earth 🌍 and in space 🚀. Join us on this mission towards a sustainable future! 🌿💚
